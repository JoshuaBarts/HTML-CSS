            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Originally used in tropical, often developing countries, the tuk tuk is an urban way of transportation. Known in many different ways – rickshaw being perhaps the most famous – the motorized vehicles earned the nickname we use due to the sound they make while in movement. Now rapidly expanding onto the area of tourism, these multi-person bikes are tourism’s next big thing – being especially advantageous to the city of Lisbon as a quick and comfy way to explore the capital’s narrow and winding streets.

            Created in a number of different models, the rickshaw was originally a wheeled contraption pulled by human force. Used as a mean of transportation in the 19th century, its popularity died off with the invention of cars and other forms of engine-run public transportation. However, it re-establishing its success during the 20th century with the invention of both motorized and cycling versions of the old and lowly form of transportation. During the Second World War period, rickshaw taxi services appeared in order to preserve the short supply of petroleum.

            The motorized autorickshaws – our tuk tuks – are prominent in the Asian, African and South American continents, where they are used for taxi services. They are divided between two, three and four-wheeled vehicles, and each country across the globe has created their own nicknames for the vehicle. Referred to as ‘bajaji’ in Tanzania and Cambodia, ‘tik tik’ in Madagascar and even ‘baby taxi’ in Bangladesh, where the decoration of the vehicles has become a form of art, this form of transportation has recently travelled to Europe, where they are most commonly used for rental or touristic purposes.

            Local Tuk Tuk’s vehicles are three-wheeled and ensure you the safety and comfort needed for your tours. With an ergonomic design that still appeals to a sleek and trendy style, the tuk tuks are equipped with cushioned seats and a removable cover to adapt to weather conditions. The vehicles can be regarded as improved and expanded, group-oriented motorcycles, created to replace bulky cars or buses in which you’d previously tour in.
            Our fleet offers tuk tuks that range from a capacity of two to six people, with a great majority of them being eco-friendly, electric fuelled vehicles.</p>
